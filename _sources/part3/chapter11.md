# Chapter 11: Advanced Components

## What you will learn
In this chapter we will introduce several advanced components that go beyond what we have seen so far, but that are necessary for advanced apps.

```{admonition} Learning Intentions
- How to look for additional components
- Familiarize with some of the most common advanced components
```

## 11.1 Introducing advanced components
Dash libraries include a lot of components that serves multiple purposes. It may be a bit overwhelming to navigate through all components, in search for the one that works for our needs. In this chapter we will provide some structure around the components you may include in your app.

We will broke down components into categories, grouping together components that serve the same purpose. For each category, we will present some of the most common components in detail.

All advanced components that will be presented come from these three very common libraries. By clicking on the links, you'll be able to access to each library documentation:
- dcc : [Dash core components](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components)
- dbc : [Dash boostrap components](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/docs/components/)
- dmc : [Dash mantine components](https://dash-mantine-components.herokuapp.com/)

In the links above, it is possible to search for keywords and find the components we need. Once we've identified the components that we want to include in our app, [this cheatsheet](https://dashcheatsheet.pythonanywhere.com/) is another powerful tool that helps us understanding how components can be customised.
