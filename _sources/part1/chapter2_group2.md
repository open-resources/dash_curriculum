# Chapter 2 (Group 2)

## Procedure for Activity together

- Talk about what challenges people have when first being exposed to Dash
    - File structure (multi-page apps, paths for images/files)
    - Development environment (ie difficult with Jupyter notebooks)
    - Use virtual environment
    - Callbacks
    - Inserting Plotly figure into Dashboard
    - HTML/CSS concepts (width, height, etc)
    - Identifying errors and debugging
    - Seperation of Plotly and Dash to identify bugs
    - App layout (ie using DBC rows/columns)
- Refer back to the Dash Tutorial, and identify areas where people can be "taught" some concepts 
- Order in which they need to be taught dash
    - Make virtual environment
    - Install libraries (Dash, core components, etc..)
    - Make main.py with smallest possible example (hello world!)
    - Launch and use app in browser, explain how we're serving the web page (maybe change the port number)
    - Introduce debugging (live debugging to change the hello world message, or introduce bugs)
    - Introduce folder structures and assets (put an image in a folder, then display it in the dashboard)
    - Drop-down to edit data in a graph (demonstrates the power of Dash over Plotly)
- Which parts to focus on when installing stack

Outcome of this activity:

- an ordered and unordered list of topics/sections that belong in this first chapter

### Reminder of the "intended order"

Chapter 2: Getting Started with Dash

- Structure of a Dash app
- Installation and setup
- Create your first Dash app
- Live updates and debugging
  - how to stop your app (and why you should) (Ctrl+C)
  - how to update your app (Ctrl+C and then re-run)
  - how to turn on "live updating" (with debug=True) and what this means (i.e. what happens if you have a syntax error and your app crashes)
