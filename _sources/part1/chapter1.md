## What is a dashboard?

A dashboard is a type of graphical user interface which often provides at-a-glance views of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

## How to use dashboards?

## Principles of effective dashboard design

Common roles for data visualization include:

- showing change over time
- showing a part-to-whole composition
- looking at how data is distributed
- comparing values between groups

## Ways users can interact with dashboards

## How to make dashboards accessible?

## The importance of dashboards in data analysis projects

- Quicker exploration than with coding.
- Can enable people without programming skills to understand data better.
- Can engage users to more than static visualisations.
- Can lead to more engaging storytelling in data journalism.
- When there is too much data, interactivity can allow us to look at subsets.
- People can be interested in different things when they look at the same data.
