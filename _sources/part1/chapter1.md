# Chapter 1: Introduction to Dashboards

These days, understanding data is the key to making the best decisions for any business. However, the amount of information that’s available at any time can be overwhelming for the most data-savvy person.

So what’s the key to making data-driven decisions? Finding the most important data and formatting it in a way that’s easy to understand. This can change, depending on who will view the data. If you’re an industry expert, you may find complex data easier to understand. If you’re presenting data to less well-versed stakeholders at your company, you may need to simplify it before sharing it with others.

One of the easiest ways to make data easy to understand for technical and non-technical audiences is to create a dashboard that easily displays all of your data visualizations in one place. This chapter gives you a short introduction into dashboards.

## What is a dashboard?

A dashboard is a type of graphical user interface which often provides at-a-glance views of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

In essence, a dashboard is a board that displays information, usually as some key numbers and a few panels of plots.

## How to use dashboards?

Behind the scenes, a dashboard connects to your files (like an Excel spreadsheet or Google sheet), attachments, services (like QuickBooks or HubSpot) and APIs. A dashboard transforms the raw data into something human-readable. Instead of sifting through columns or rows in a spreadsheet, you can analyze your data in a table, line chart, bubble chart, or bar chart, just to name a few options.

Dashboards aggregate data from multiple data sources. A dashboard isn’t just about saving time, but seeing all of your data together in one place. Comparing to a classical business report a dashboard sets itself apart as it shifts the perspective from a periodic reporting to a constant monitoring. Common roles for data visualization include:

- showing change over time
- showing a part-to-whole composition
- looking at how data is distributed
- comparing values between groups
- observing relationships between variables
- looking at geographical data

## Principles of effective dashboard design

Very good overview: https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/starter-guide-to-dashboard-design.

Questions you should start with:

- Who is my audience?
- What information do they need?
- What do they already know about the metrics?
- What is their level of experience with data?
- What are their prejudices in terms of visualizations and colours?

Best Practices for dashboard design:

- Design different dashboards for different business needs
- Add comparison values
- Consider your dashboard layout
- Pick the right visualizations
- Proper use of colour
- Easy-to-read information
- Design for different displays

## The importance of dashboards in data analysis projects

Like already mentioned before, the difference is about the shift in perspective from periodic reporting (like quarterly or yearly) to continued monitoring (like daily or weekly). What makes dashboards and reports so valuable is how you and your team use them to your advantage.

- Access to historical data
- Trend analysis to see what's worked (or what hasn't) in the past to shift your approach for the future
- Bring multiple metrics together
- Visualize your data

Differences between dashboards and reports
- Dashboards are interactive—you can segment, filter, and visualize your data
- Dashboards display live, dynamically updated data (as your data source updates, your dashboard does too)
- Reports share information on known areas of interest or goals
- Dashboards monitor known areas of interest or goals

Herefore, dashboards are essential for any holistic analysis on data. The importance of dashboards among others can be found in the following benefits:

- Quicker exploration than with coding.
- Can enable people without programming skills to understand data better.
- Can engage users to more than static visualisations.
- Can lead to more engaging storytelling in data journalism.
- When there is too much data, interactivity can allow us to look at subsets.
- People can be interested in different things when they look at the same data.
