# Chapter 0 - Stack Installation
## What you will learn

In this chapter we will set up the tech stack used in this course.  A **tech stack** is a combination of tools used to build and run an application.  For this course we have chosen the most popular professional tools to develop our applications.

- **Visual Studio Code**
  - VScode is a program that we will use to edit and debug our code
  - VScode Extensions help us to code and improve productivity
  - **Note**: There are many different [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide) options but using VScode will make for a smoother learning experience for this course
- **Python**
  - Python is the programming language we will use to build our applications
  - We will use various Python [libraries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/libraries-in-python/) (such as Dash and Pandas) as the primary building blocks for our application
- **Git**
  - Git is a [version control systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/version-control-systems/) that is used to track and manage changes to our code over time in a [repository](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-git-repository/)
  - [Learn Git in 15 minutes](https://youtu.be/USjZcfj8yxE)
- **Github**
  -  Github is a website that hosts Git repositories, which we will use to store our code.
