# Chapter 0: Tech Stack

In this chapter we will set up the tech stack used in this guide.

```{tip}   
A **tech stack** is a combination of tools and technologies needed to accomplish a particular task. In our case, it's all the items we need installed to run and create a Dash application.
```

We have chosen some popular tools for this guide, but if you already have an established workflow, you should be able to follow along with your own tools.

## What you will learn

After deliberate review of this lesson, consideration of supplementary content, and sufficient practice, we intend for you to be able to:

- Install Python, Git, VS Code on your computer
- Install necessary python packages
- Create and access your GitHub account
- Link your GitHub account to your computer

## Installation Instructions

The installation instructions are split by your computer's operating system:

- [**Mac**](chapter0_mac.md)
- [**Windows**](chapter0_windows.md)
- [**Linux**](chapter0_linux.md)

Once you have completed the installation instructions for your system, you should then complete the configuration by linking your GitHub account to your computer.

- [**Complete GitHub setup**](chapter0_GitHub.md)
