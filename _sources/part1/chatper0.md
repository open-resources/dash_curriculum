# Chapter 0 - Stack Installation
## Overview

In this chapter we will set up the tech stack used in this course.  A **tech stack** is a combination of tools used to build and run an application.  For this course we have chosen the most popular professional tools to develop our applicatoins.

- **Visual Studio Code**
  - Code editor and debugger
  - Extensions help us to code and improve productivity
- **Python**
  - Programming language we will use
  - Python libraries (such as Dash and Pandas) are collections of code that we will use to make the applications
- **Git**
  - Version control systems allow us to track and manage changes to our code over time
  - [Learn Git in 15 minutes](https://youtu.be/USjZcfj8yxE)
- **Github**
  -  Website that will store our repository
  - **Git** is not related to **Github**.  Github is a website that stores [repositories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A26ybw6tGY), and Git is a version control system.


## Installation Instructions
[**Windows**](chapter0_windows.md)\
[**Mac**](chapter0_mac.md)\
[**Linux**](chapter0_linux.md)

## Test the stack
Let's make sure everything is installed correctly.  Open VScode and create a new file called **main.py**.  Copy and paste this code:
```
import dash 
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import pandas


print("Hello World!")
```
Then press **F5** to debug/run the file.  If we see **Hello World!** printed out in the console then we know the Python code is working properly with all libraries installed.

Now that we have our **main.py** file running let's use ```git``` to track the file in our repository.  Go to the terminal in VScode and type ```git status```.  We see that there is a new **Untracked file** called **main.py**:

We'll **add** that file to the git **staging area** with ```git add main.py```:

Then we need to **commit** the changes.  Type in ```git commit -m "This is a commit message"```.  Every commit needs a message and this is a good opportunity to include a short reminder of what this commit changed:

Lastly, we will push the changes to our Github repo with ```git push```
