# Content idea:
- Show and describe the following App as the main baseline where some enhancements have been introduced (navbar, theme toggle)
- Go through the creation of a button which print out the registry on the console and examine it
- Rename URLs
- Sort pages differently (e.g. Graph page before Extras)
- Add a meta tag example
