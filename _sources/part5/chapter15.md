# chapter 15: Making Multi-page Apps

- A few words on what multipage layouts are possible
- Building multi-page app examples

# Content idea:
Show 3 examples of the same App, with enriched content:

Example 01 - Multi page basic features:
- App with 3-4 pages, with one component each from the Gapminder data
- No specific components to navigate through pages (no navbar, ...)
- Pages are reached by changing url

Example 02 - Enriched layout:
- Same app from example 01
- Adding : Navbar / dropdown menu to navigate among pages
- Adding : theme switcher
(Example = https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-multi-page-app-demos/tree/main/multi_page_example1)

Example 03 - Basic Auth functionality:
- Same app from example 02
- Adding : a new page with required authentication / authentication required to the overall app
(Basic Auth = https://dash.plotly.com/authentication#basic-auth)
(Example = https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-multi-page-app-demos/tree/main/multi_page_fask_login)
